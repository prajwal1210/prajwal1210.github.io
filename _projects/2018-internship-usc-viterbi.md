As one of the 18 people across India to be selected for IUSSTF-Viterbi Summer Research Program, I spent my summer of 2018 working under the guidance of Prof. Meisam Razaviyayn and did the following:
• A literature study of previous works related to Quantization and Binarization of Neural Networks
• Came up with the idea of adaptively quantizing different layers of a neural network with different number of bits
• Modified existing Tensorflow and Pytorch models to test out various hypothesis to improve accuracy
• Studied the effect of different regularizers to aid in the quantization/binarization of the layers of a neural network
• Developed an algorithm using regularization to optimally choose the quantization for each layer during training
