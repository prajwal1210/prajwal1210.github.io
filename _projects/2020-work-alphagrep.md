As a Senior Associate - Trading Systems at AlphaGrep, I accomplished the following:
- Lead a team of four members to develop and maintain order management and market data infrastructure for crypto exchanges like Binance, Deribit, etc., and FIX-based exchanges like SocGen, Instinet, etc.
- Developed the core order-routing framework for rapid onboarding of crypto exchanges. It abstracted features like disconnect recovery, HTTP-Websocket arbitration, etc., from exchange-specific code.
- Developed and maintained low-latency order management and drop-copy infrastructure for NSE, adding support for features like ORS-DC trade arbing, risk checks for options trading, and many more.
- Continually involved in latency optimizations for high-frequency trading software built on C++, based on concepts like cache-warming for real-time systems, kernel-bypass for networking applications, etc.
