During my internship at Tower Research Capital Pvt. Ltd. (Gurgaon, India), I completed the following tasks:
- Set up a pipeline for simulation of an existing monitoring tool on historical dates which will help configure better parameters for the tool in the future
- Deployed an end-to-end product for the same; developed the backend using C++, Bash, Python (Flask) and the UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Incorporated features like higher replay rate for the simulation tool and better log readability (critical for building up analytics) into existing codebases
- Used the ELK stack to index the logs of the monitoring tool and create visualizations for log analysis on Kibana, which is critical for risk assessment
