As a summer intern in the Information and Communications Lab of Taiwan's most prestigious R&D Institute, I did the following:
- Worked on a "Musical Style" Recognizer to classify music into the genres: rock, jazz, classical, gospel, rap
- Trained the model on our own dataset of 5000 musical pieces(of 1-minute duration each) extracted from Youtube
- Used the weights of the trained CNN classifier to implement Neural Style Transfer on the pre-processed inputs (spectrograms from mp3 files) and get a musical piece with the desired melody in the desired style
